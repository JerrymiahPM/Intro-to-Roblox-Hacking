# ðŸ”¥ Variables

As you learned in the previous tutorial.  Variables store a value which can be accessed later in the program.

### nil datatype

Nil = None = null = no value, these are all equivalent.  If you don't know what any of those words mean, then your missing one of the prerequisites.  Pretty simple, it basically is when nothing is assigned to the variable.

### String datatype

First, what is a string? A string is basically just text.  If you want to store something as a string, you need to enclose it in parenthesis "".  Take a look at the example below. <br/>

As you can see, we created a variable called name.  Then we initialized it.  Inititializing a variable is basically the act of assigning a value to a variable.  In this case, we assigned a string containing "My Name"
