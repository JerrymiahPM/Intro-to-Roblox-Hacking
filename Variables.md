# ðŸ”¥ Variables

As you learned in the previous tutorial.  Variables store a value which can be accessed later in the program.

### nil datatype

Nil = None = null = no value, these are all equivalent.  If you don't know what any of those words mean, then your missing one of the prerequisites.  Pretty simple, it basically is when nothing is assigned to the variable.

### String datatype

First, what is a string? A string is basically just text.  If you want to store something as a string, you need to enclose it in parenthesis "".  Take a look at the example below. <br/>

As you can see, we created a variable called name.  Then we initialized it.  Inititializing a variable is basically the act of assigning a value to a variable.  In this case, we assigned a string containing "My Name".

### Boolean datatype

Next we'll talk about a boolean.  A boolean can have 2 values.  True or False.  
- DO NOT put parenthesis around the true or the false
- YOU MUST make the word true and false all lowercase
Check out the example below. <br/>

Above we create a variable called isAbove21.  In this case, it is set to true.  You could set it to false.  You'll see why we need these in the future.
