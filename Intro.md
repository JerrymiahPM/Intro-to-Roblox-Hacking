# The beginning

Let's start off with variables.  Essentially, variables store information inside them which can be reused throughout your code.  You start off by defining a variable.  Examine the code below <br/>

The code above uses a [**keyword**](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#:~:text=The%20following%20keywords%20are%20reserved%20and%20cannot%20be%20used%20as%20names%3A).  A keyword is a word reserved by lua, which cannot be used as a name.  You'll see a lot more later on.  The local **keyword** is how you define a variable.  We'll talk about different variables later.
The word after the keyword local is the name of the variable, it can be any word except a keyword, read more about what a variable can and can't be [here](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#:~:text=2.1%20%E2%80%93%20Lexical%20Conventions).

### Next we'll want to assign a value to a variable.  Whats the point of a [nil](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#:~:text=2.2%20%E2%80%93%20Values%20and%20Types) variable?
