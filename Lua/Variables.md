# ðŸ”¥ Variables

As you learned in the previous tutorial.  Variables store a value which can be accessed later in the program.  Next we'll talk about datatypes.  But first, what are datatypes?  A datatype is basically just the type of the value.  Is it a string or is it a number?

## nil datatype

Nil = None = null = no value, these are all equivalent.  If you don't know what any of those words mean, then your missing one of the prerequisites.  Pretty simple, it basically is when nothing is assigned to the variable.  You can assign a nil variable by doing the following

We call this defining a variable.  It creates a variable with the value of nil.

#### How would we use this in roblox exploiting?

If you want to later define it and just want to create it in scope.

## String datatype

First, what is a string? A string is basically just text.  If you want to store something as a string, you need to enclose it in parenthesis "".  Take a look at the example below.

As you can see, we created a variable called name.  Then we initialized it.  Inititializing a variable is basically the act of assigning a value to a variable.  In this case, we assigned a string containing "My Name".

#### How would we use this in roblox exploiting?

Well, you could use it if you want to define a string which is used multiple times.  Maybe a name of your exploit name.

## Boolean datatype

Next we'll talk about a boolean.  A boolean can have 2 values.  True or False.  
- DO NOT put parenthesis around the true or the false
- YOU MUST make the word true and false all lowercase
Check out the example below.

Above we create a variable called isAbove21.  In this case, it is set to true.  It could be set it to false.  You'll see why we need these in the future.

#### How would we use this in roblox exploiting?

You could use it when using if statements or checking if a feature is enabled.  We'll learn about checking/if statements later.

## Number datatype

A number datatype is basically just a number like 6 or 92.4543.  It's pretty simple.  I'll show you an example down below.
